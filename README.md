<h1>iOS Workout Shortcut</h1>
  This apple shortcut is meant to function as a replacement for a workout application. Currently it gives you a random workout from a set of exercises that you can choose. It is set up for one workout to consist of 5 exercises each with 3 sets (this is customizable).

<h2>Setup</h2>
  <h3>Download</h3>
    The sharelink to the shortcut is here: <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/ffbeaed5c5114ed1b9fbd04713948a48" target="_blank">Shortcut</a>
  <h3>Folder Structure</h3>
    The default shortcut links to a folder called "Exercises" which inside has a .Gif file called "timer" which displays between your sets and two folders: "Data" and "GIFs".     Inside of the "Data" folder is two .txt files: Exercise History.txt and Recent Exercises.txt. Lastly, the "GIFs" folder contains all of the .gif files of the exercises you wish to have available in your workout.

<h2>Known Problems</h2>
  <ul>
      <li>Sometimes not all of the characters will be saved after entering data into the Set info popup. I suggest clicking into another textbox when you're done putting in your last item. This is a problem on Apple's end.</li>
  </ul>
